removed neovim setup from scratch.sh. Tested new kickstart nvim config. -- Looks nice but again the learning curve is very high. I don't think I will need this as I don't develop enough. In future I will not install neovim in my principle setup, if I need it I can develop within a virtual machine like devbox, and install neovim in that.

### michele boiler fix and issues
Boiler fixed today, required a new pump and diverter valve, worcester engineer also brought up some issues, the oil line is close to a manhole, which is impossible to rectify. There is no cage around the flu, maybe able to fit one? there was a slight weep (now fixed as the worcester engineer tightened the joint up.) the clear plastic air valve? needs replacing with a metal one as the plastic ones are not up to code. also the cooker needs a chain on the back of it, but I would prefer to replace the cooker anyway, maybe electric? Or maybe a new gas one. Need to find an oftec heating engineer to do the burner service and change fix the issues above.
